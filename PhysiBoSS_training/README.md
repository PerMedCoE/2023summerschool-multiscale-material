# PhysiBoSS 2.0: a sustainable integration of stochastic Boolean and agent-based modelling frameworks

**Version:** 2.0

**Release date:** XXX 2021

## Overview: 
PhysiBoSS 2.0 is a redesign and reimplementation of PhysiBoSS ([doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/bty766](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/bty766)). It has been conceived as an add-on that expands the PhysiCell ([doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005991](https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005991)) agent-based functionalities with intracellular cell signalling using MaBoSS having a decoupled, maintainable and model-agnostic design. PhysiBoSS 2.0 reproduces simulations reported in the original PhysiBoSS publications and can be used with other Boolean models, for instance to predict drug synergy in a gastric adenocarcinoma cell line.

### How to run a PhysiBoSS sample_project inside PhysiCell:
~~~bash
git clone https://github.com/PhysiBoSS/PhysiBoSS.git
cd PhysiBoSS
make physiboss-tnf-model
make
./spheroid_TNF_model
~~~

### Key makefile rules, from [PhysiCell repository](https://github.com/MathCancer/PhysiCell):

**make \[project-name\]**: populates the indicated sample project. Use "make" to compile it. 

*PhysiBoSS \[project-name\] choices:*
- physiboss_cell_lines
- spheroid-TNF-model
- drug-AGS (coming soon, curently available in the [former repo](https://github.com/bsc-life/PhysiBoSSv2))

*PhysiCell \[project-name\] choices:*
- biorobots-sample
- cancer-biorobots-sample
- cancer-immune-sample 
- heterogeneity-sample
- template
- template2D
- template3D
- virus-macrophage-sample

**make** : compiles the current project. If no project has been defined, it first populates the cancer heterogeneity 2D sample project and compiles it 

**make list-projects** : list all available sample projects 

**make clean** : removes all .o files and the executable, so that the next "make" recompiles the entire project 

**make data-cleanup** : clears out all simulation data 

**make reset** : de-populates the sample project and returns to the original PhysiCell state. Use this when switching to a new PhysiCell sample project.
